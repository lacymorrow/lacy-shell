## [1.1.0] - 2024-12-19 - SMART AUTO MODE üß†

### ‚ö° Major Enhancement: Intelligent Auto Mode

**Smart Command Execution**: Auto mode now executes real commands first, then falls back to AI
- **Command-First Strategy**: Real shell commands execute immediately without AI overhead
- **Natural Language Detection**: Obvious questions go directly to AI (no failed shell attempts)
- **Smart Fallback**: Unknown commands try shell first, then automatically ask AI for help
- **Better Performance**: Eliminates unnecessary AI calls for standard commands

### üéØ New Smart Auto Mode Features
- `lacy_shell_execute_smart_auto()` - Core smart execution logic
- `lacy_shell_command_exists()` - Robust command existence checking (includes builtins)
- `lacy_shell_is_obvious_natural_language()` - Natural language pattern detection
- Smart routing indicators: üíª for commands, ü§ñ for AI, ‚ùì for fallback attempts

### üß™ Testing & Validation
- `test-smart-auto.sh` - Comprehensive test suite for smart auto mode
- `test_smart_auto` alias for quick function testing
- Real-world test cases covering edge cases and common scenarios

### üìà Performance Improvements
- ‚ö° Real commands execute instantly (no AI delay)
- üß† Natural language bypasses shell attempts
- üîÑ Graceful fallback maintains workflow continuity
- üìö Educational feedback when introducing new tools

### üîÑ Breaking Changes
- Auto mode behavior significantly improved (backwards compatible)
- Detection logic now optimized for performance over pattern matching
- Mode descriptions updated to reflect new "try shell first" behavior

## [1.0.1] - 2024-12-19 - PRODUCTION HARDENING üõ°Ô∏è

### üö® Critical Fixes
- **Fixed Input "Swallowing" Issue**: Resolved commands disappearing with no feedback
- **MCP Server Error Handling**: Added proper startup validation and error reporting
- **Emergency Recovery System**: Multiple escape routes when things go wrong
- **API Timeout Protection**: 30-second timeout prevents hanging on AI calls

### üîß New Emergency Commands
- `!command` - Emergency bypass prefix for direct shell execution
- `disable_lacy` - Disable input interception entirely (alias: `lacy_shell_disable_interception`)
- `enable_lacy` - Re-enable input interception (alias: `lacy_shell_enable_interception`)
- `mcp_check` - Verify MCP package dependencies with installation instructions
- `mode status` - Show detailed mode information including persistence state

### üõ°Ô∏è Reliability Improvements
- Pre-flight API key validation before agent execution
- Process validation for MCP servers with PID checking
- Clear error messages with actionable troubleshooting steps
- Graceful fallback to shell execution when AI services unavailable
- Enhanced error logging for MCP server diagnostics

### üìö Documentation Updates
- Comprehensive troubleshooting section in README
- Emergency recovery procedures in all docs
- API documentation for new diagnostic functions
- Architecture docs updated with error handling patterns

### üéØ Mode Persistence Enhancement
- **Persistent Mode Memory**: Your preferred mode is saved across shell sessions
- Mode state file: `~/.lacy-shell/current_mode`
- Enhanced `mode status` command shows current, default, and saved modes
- Graceful handling of invalid saved modes with fallback to default

## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-19
